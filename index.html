  <p>HMM has 2 main versions. Both are under devlopment</p>
  
  <div class="row">
  <div class="version-list">
  <h3>One Click,Lmited People Mailed</h3>
  <p>In this version , there is a limited number of users you can mail , But after entering all rec_emails (Rreiciver emails) , you'll be 1 click away from sending the mails, altogether.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="version-list">
  <h3>Unlimited Set of users,3 second cooldown</h3>
  <p>As the name says , It has a 3 second cooldown . It means that the program will ask you every recipent's email individually and will mail them one by one , unlike the other version in which it mails all the recipents altogether.</p>

  <img src="SubsciptionHMM(1).jpg">
  <h3>No Paid Subsriptions!</h3>
  <p>Unlike Most Mass Mailing services which put users's behind those who spend money , in HMM there are no paid subscriptions/anything that may potentialy put you behind other users!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="features-col">
  <img src="UnderDevLopmentHmm.jpg">
  <h3>Frequent Updates</h3>
  <p>Since HMM is permannetly under development , it may get a lot of new features . But with that in mind , there is only 1 devloper who's working on this project , therefore there may/may not be VERY frequent , But I will Try my best to put them forward ASAP</p>
